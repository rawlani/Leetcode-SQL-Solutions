# What is Data?
Data in it simplest form is the combination of rows and columns where each row tells a particular story of one particular case out of billion possibilities and each column is a variables with similar or different value in each cases. Understanding each cases by human and analyzing the trend or predicting what lies in future with some kind of permutations and combinations of different variables is near to impossible. That's where we start relying on machine!

This all sounds may be intimidating for some but people like me finds it really interesting. Its cool!! Just Imagine!!

# Beforehand
Before anyone thinks that they are ready for applying Machine Learning Algorithmswe, its necessary to know that before you apply any of those, its necessary to clean the data. Cleaning steps include : Data Wrangling / Data Manipulation / Data Extraction depending on how the data is at the initial position. Unfortunately, in Data Analysis process, 80% of the time is consumed by Data Cleaning step. Therefore, its necessary to first convert the data which is easy to understand and debug.

# Pre-requisites
1. Basic Understanding of Python
2. Basic understanding of how to use Pandas/Numpy

# What will you learn?
1. Each cases will teach you how to approach for a particular issue in Data cleaning steps
2. Perform web scraping using Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup
3. Use the fundamental and advanced level of Pandas DataFrames and Numpy
4. Some specific issues in cases which requires different library or built-in to simplify your problem

# Main Python Libraries used yet
1. Pandas
2. Numpy
